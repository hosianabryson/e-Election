                        development and Gender policy (2000), women can render <br> 
                        a significant contribution in promoting well being of their families 
                        and communities. In rural communities, <br>
                        on my side individuals usually possess traditional<br> 
                         viewpoints and perspectives in terms of women. They are discriminated and regarded<br> 
                          as liabilities and more preference is given to male members. When a girl is born <br> 
                          within the family, she is discouraged from getting enrolled in school and acquiring<br>  
                          educational qualification.  </p>
            Girls are trained in terms of implementation of household<br> 
                responsibilities. Much lower percentage of females enter tertiary education institutions.<br> 
                 Only 6% of students in technical and vocational training institutions are female. <br> 
                 At University of Dar es salaam the enrolment is 15%. There is less access to education<br> 
                  of female compared to males resulting into adult literacy rates for women<br> 
               to be 57% compared to 80% for males. Majority of women are engaged in agriculture since</p>
